        <h1>O Brasil com &quot;s&quot;</h1>
        <p>
          There are two ways of spelling Brasil - Brazil with the &quot;z&quot;
          and Brasil with the &quot;s&quot;.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To only know Brazil with the &quot;z&quot; in terms of being a tourist
          is completely fine. You will definitely enjoy it. There is a lot to
          see like the beautiful beaches along the coast, the rainforest (Amazon
          and Atlantic), the mountain ranges, and desserts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now to know Brasil with the &quot;s&quot; is to learn the way of the
          brasileiro. This ranges from Capoeira, Samba, Futevolei, Altinha,
          Forro, and of course Portugues do Brasileiros. You will have to learn
          the language, but you do not need to be fluent because their
          hospitality will make up for any of the words you don&apos;t know.
          Instead of just enjoying Brasil, you might fall in love with
          everything the country has to offer!!!!

          To preface, it started when I spent 3 weeks in Brasil visiting an old
          friend and joining in on the Carnaval fun - especially the "festa da
          rua" (street party) in February of 2023. One year later I moved to
          Brasil, and have been here for ~3 months now.
