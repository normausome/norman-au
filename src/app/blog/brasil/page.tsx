        <h1>O BraSil com &quot;S&quot;!</h1>
        <p>
          There are two ways of spelling Brasil - Brazil with the &quot;z&quot;
          and Brasil with the &quot;s&quot;.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To only know Brazil with the &quot;z&quot; in terms of being a tourist
          is completely fine. You will definitely enjoy it. There is a lot to
          see like the beautiful beaches along the coast, the rainforest (Amazon
          and Atlantic), the mountain ranges, and deserts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now to know Brasil with the &quot;s&quot; is to learn the way of the
          brasileiro. Brasil is rich in people, culture and history - people who
          have come from Africa, Portugal, Germany, Italy, and Japan. This
          ranges from:
        </p>{" "}
        <ul>
          <li>
            Brazilian People (warmest ppl you will ever meet - they need to be
            studied!!!)
          </li>
          <li>Capoeira</li>
          <li>Samba</li>
          <li>Futevolei</li>
          <li>Altinha</li>
          <li>Forro</li>
          <li>Passinho</li>
          <li>Favelas</li>
          <li>Brazilian Portuguese</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You will have to learn the language, but you do not need to be fluent
          because their hospitality will make up for any of the words you
          don&apos;t know. Instead of just enjoying Brasil, you might fall in
          love with everything the country has to offer!

          To preface, it started when I spent 3 weeks in Brasil visiting an old
          friend and joining in on the Carnaval fun - especially the "festa da
          rua" (street party) in February of 2023. One year later I moved to
          Brasil, and have been here for ~3 months now.
